# Vault Architect

An AI-powered semantic folder placement and vault organization plugin for Obsidian.

Vault Architect uses OpenAI's language models to analyze your notes and recommend optimal folder placements based on semantic content analysis. It helps maintain a well-organized vault structure that reflects the actual content and relationships between your notes.

## Features

### 🎯 AI-Powered Folder Recommendations
- **Semantic Analysis**: Analyzes note content, tags, headings, and links to understand context
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends the best folder placement with confidence scores and reasoning
- **Multiple Options**: Provides primary recommendation plus alternatives
- **New Folder Detection**: Suggests creating new folders when existing ones don't fit

### 📦 Batch Inbox Classification
- **Process Multiple Notes**: Classify entire folders (like your Inbox) in one operation
- **Preview Before Moving**: Review all proposed moves with confidence scores
- **Selective Application**: Choose which recommendations to apply
- **Confidence Filtering**: Only shows recommendations above your configured threshold

### 🔍 Vault Structure Analysis
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Get detailed analysis of your vault organization
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies orphaned notes, overcrowded folders, semantic overlaps
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Receive actionable suggestions for improvements
- **Health Scoring**: See your vault's organizational health score

### 📝 Automatic Folder Note Generation
- **Document Folders**: Auto-generate index/README files for folders
- **Content Summaries**: Includes descriptions of notes within the folder
- **Relationship Mapping**: Documents related folders and key topics
- **Customizable Names**: Supports index.md, _index.md, README.md, and custom names

### 🔗 Smart Connections Integration
- **Vector Embeddings**: Uses Smart Connections plugin for semantic similarity (when available)
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to OpenAI embeddings if Smart Connections not available
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Leverages existing embeddings for better recommendations

## How It Works

Vault Architect combines Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with vector space mathematics to provide highly accurate organization recommendations.

### The Recommendation Pipeline

1.  **Context Gathering**: When triggered, the plugin scans your current note (title, content, tags, frontmatter) and captures a snapshot of your vault's folder structure (descriptions, file counts, representative files).
2.  **LLM Analysis**: This structured context is sent to the OpenAI API. The model evaluates the semantic meaning of your note against the descriptions and contents of your existing folders.
3.  **Vector Enhancement**: If Smart Connections is active, the plugin simultaneously calculates the mathematical similarity between your note and your folders (see below).
4.  **Hybrid Scoring**: The linguistic confidence from the LLM is blended with the vector similarity score to produce a final "Weighted Confidence" score.
5.  **Presentation**: The best matches are presented in a streamlined modal, allowing you to preview the move or select an alternative.

### Folder Centroid Similarity Engine

For users with the [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections) plugin installed, Vault Architect activates its advanced **Folder Centroid Similarity Engine**. This system grounds the AI's suggestions in the actual mathematical relationships of your notes, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy for niche topics.

#### 1. Vector Embeddings
The engine reuses the existing embeddings generated by Smart Connections (stored in `.smart-env`), avoiding any need for re-indexing or extra API costs. These are 384-dimensional vectors representing the semantic meaning of your notes.

#### 2. Centroid Calculation
For every folder in your vault, the engine calculates a **Folder Centroid**.
*   Mathematically, this is the average vector of all valid note embeddings within that folder.
*   Conceptually, this represents the "thematic center of gravity" for that folder.
*   *Example*: If a folder contains notes about "Python", "JavaScript", and "C++", the centroid represents the abstract concept of "Programming Languages".

#### 3. Folder Coherence
Not all folders are created equal. The engine calculates a **Coherence Score** (0.0 to 1.0) for each folder by measuring the average similarity between the notes inside it.
*   **High Coherence (e.g., 0.85)**: A tightly focused folder (e.g., "Recipes/Italian"). The notes are all very similar.
*   **Low Coherence (e.g., 0.3)**: A loose collection (e.g., "Inbox" or "Misc"). The notes are unrelated.

#### 4. Adaptive Hybrid Scoring
The final recommendation score is a dynamic blend of the LLM's reasoning and the Vector Similarity.
*   **The Formula**: `FinalScore = (LLM_Score * (1 - Coherence)) + (Vector_Similarity * Coherence)`
*   **The Effect**:
    *   For **highly coherent folders**, the engine trusts the math more. If your note mathematically fits perfectly into a specific project folder, that signal overrides the LLM's general guess.
    *   For **loose folders**, the engine trusts the LLM more. Since the folder has no clear "vector center," the LLM's linguistic understanding of the folder's purpose (e.g., "Archive") is more accurate.
